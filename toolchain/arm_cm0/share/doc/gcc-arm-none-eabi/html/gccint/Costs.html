<p><a name="index-costs-of-instructions-4487"></a><a name="index-relative-costs-4488"></a><a name="index-speed-of-instructions-4489"></a>
These macros let you describe the relative speed of various operations
on the target machine.

<blockquote><p>A C expression for the cost of moving data of mode <var>mode</var> from a
register in class <var>from</var> to one in class <var>to</var>.  The classes are
expressed using the enumeration values such as <code>GENERAL_REGS</code>.  A
value of 2 is the default; other values are interpreted relative to
that.

      <p>It is not required that the cost always equal 2 when <var>from</var> is the
same as <var>to</var>; on some machines it is expensive to move between
registers if they are not general registers.

      <p>If reload sees an insn consisting of a single <code>set</code> between two
hard registers, and if <code>REGISTER_MOVE_COST</code> applied to their
classes returns a value of 2, reload does not check to ensure that the
constraints of the insn are met.  Setting a cost of other than 2 will
allow reload to verify that the constraints are met.  You should do this
if the `<samp><span class="samp">mov</span><var>m</var></samp>' pattern's constraints do not allow such copying.

      <p>These macros are obsolete, new ports should use the target hook
<code>TARGET_REGISTER_MOVE_COST</code> instead.

&mdash; Macro: <b>MEMORY_MOVE_COST</b> (<var>mode, class, in</var>)<var><a name="index-MEMORY_005fMOVE_005fCOST-4492"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>A C expression for the cost of moving data of mode <var>mode</var> between a
register of class <var>class</var> and memory; <var>in</var> is zero if the value
is to be written to memory, nonzero if it is to be read in.  This cost
is relative to those in <code>REGISTER_MOVE_COST</code>.  If moving between
registers and memory is more expensive than between two registers, you
should define this macro to express the relative cost.

      <p>If you do not define this macro, GCC uses a default cost of 4 plus
the cost of copying via a secondary reload register, if one is
needed.  If your machine requires a secondary reload register to copy
between memory and a register of <var>class</var> but the reload mechanism is
more complex than copying via an intermediate, define this macro to
reflect the actual cost of the move.

      <p>GCC defines the function <code>memory_move_secondary_cost</code> if
secondary reloads are needed.  It computes the costs due to copying via
a secondary register.  If your machine copies from memory using a
secondary register in the conventional way but the default base value of
4 is not correct for your machine, define this macro to add some other
value to the result of that function.  The arguments to that function
are the same as to this macro.

      <p>These macros are obsolete, new ports should use the target hook
<code>TARGET_MEMORY_MOVE_COST</code> instead.

&mdash; Macro: <b>BRANCH_COST</b> (<var>speed_p, predictable_p</var>)<var><a name="index-BRANCH_005fCOST-4494"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>A C expression for the cost of a branch instruction.  A value of 1 is
the default; other values are interpreted relative to that. Parameter
<var>speed_p</var> is true when the branch in question should be optimized
for speed.  When it is false, <code>BRANCH_COST</code> should return a value
optimal for code size rather than performance.  <var>predictable_p</var> is
true for well-predicted branches. On many architectures the
<code>BRANCH_COST</code> can be reduced then. 
</p></blockquote></div>

 <p>Here are additional macros which do not specify precise relative costs,
but only that certain actions are more expensive than GCC would
ordinarily expect.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>SLOW_BYTE_ACCESS</b><var><a name="index-SLOW_005fBYTE_005fACCESS-4495"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Define this macro as a C expression which is nonzero if accessing less
than a word of memory (i.e. a <code>char</code> or a <code>short</code>) is no
faster than accessing a word of memory, i.e., if such access
require more than one instruction or if there is no difference in cost
between byte and (aligned) word loads.

      <p>When this macro is not defined, the compiler will access a field by
finding the smallest containing object; when it is defined, a fullword
load will be used if alignment permits.  Unless bytes accesses are
faster than word accesses, using word accesses is preferable since it
may eliminate subsequent memory access if subsequent accesses occur to
other fields in the same word of the structure, but to different bytes. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>SLOW_UNALIGNED_ACCESS</b> (<var>mode, alignment</var>)<var><a name="index-SLOW_005fUNALIGNED_005fACCESS-4496"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Define this macro to be the value 1 if memory accesses described by the
<var>mode</var> and <var>alignment</var> parameters have a cost many times greater
than aligned accesses, for example if they are emulated in a trap
handler.  This macro is invoked only for unaligned accesses, i.e. when
<var>alignment</var><code> &lt; GET_MODE_ALIGNMENT (</code><var>mode</var><code>)</code>.

      <p>When this macro is nonzero, the compiler will act as if
<code>STRICT_ALIGNMENT</code> were nonzero when generating code for block
moves.  This can cause significantly more instructions to be produced. 
Therefore, do not set this macro nonzero if unaligned accesses only add a
cycle or two to the time for a memory access.

      <p>If the value of this macro is always zero, it need not be defined.  If
this macro is defined, it should produce a nonzero value when
<code>STRICT_ALIGNMENT</code> is nonzero. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>MOVE_RATIO</b> (<var>speed</var>)<var><a name="index-MOVE_005fRATIO-4497"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The threshold of number of scalar memory-to-memory move insns, <em>below</em>
which a sequence of insns should be generated instead of a
string move insn or a library call.  Increasing the value will always
make code faster, but eventually incurs high cost in increased code size.

      <p>Note that on machines where the corresponding move insn is a
<code>define_expand</code> that emits a sequence of insns, this macro counts
the number of such sequences.

      <p>The parameter <var>speed</var> is true if the code is currently being
optimized for speed rather than size.

      <p>If you don't define this, a reasonable default is used.

<blockquote><p>GCC will attempt several strategies when asked to copy between
two areas of memory, or to set, clear or store to memory, for example
when copying a <code>struct</code>. The <code>by_pieces</code> infrastructure
implements such memory operations as a sequence of load, store or move
insns.  Alternate strategies are to expand the
<code>movmem</code> or <code>setmem</code> optabs, to emit a library call, or to emit
unit-by-unit, loop-based operations.

      <p>This target hook should return true if, for a memory operation with a
given <var>size</var> and <var>alignment</var>, using the <code>by_pieces</code>
infrastructure is expected to result in better code generation. 
Both <var>size</var> and <var>alignment</var> are measured in terms of storage
units.

      <p>The parameter <var>op</var> is one of: <code>CLEAR_BY_PIECES</code>,
<code>MOVE_BY_PIECES</code>, <code>SET_BY_PIECES</code>, <code>STORE_BY_PIECES</code> or
<code>COMPARE_BY_PIECES</code>.  These describe the type of memory operation
under consideration.

      <p>The parameter <var>speed_p</var> is true if the code is currently being
optimized for speed rather than size.

      <p>Returning true for higher values of <var>size</var> can improve code generation
for speed if the target does not provide an implementation of the
<code>movmem</code> or <code>setmem</code> standard names, if the <code>movmem</code> or
<code>setmem</code> implementation would be more expensive than a sequence of
insns, or if the overhead of a library call would dominate that of
the body of the memory operation.

      <p>Returning true for higher values of <code>size</code> may also cause an increase
in code size, for example where the number of insns emitted to perform a
move would be greater than that of a library call.

<blockquote><p>When expanding a block comparison in MODE, gcc can try to reduce the
number of branches at the expense of more memory operations.  This hook
allows the target to override the default choice.  It should return the
factor by which branches should be reduced over the plain expansion with
one comparison per <var>mode</var>-sized piece.  A port can also prevent a
particular mode from being used for block comparisons by returning a
negative number from this hook.

<blockquote><p>This target hook describes the relative costs of RTL expressions.

      <p>The cost may depend on the precise form of the expression, which is
available for examination in <var>x</var>, and the fact that <var>x</var> appears
as operand <var>opno</var> of an expression with rtx code <var>outer_code</var>. 
That is, the hook can assume that there is some rtx <var>y</var> such
that `<samp><span class="samp">GET_CODE (</span><var>y</var><span class="samp">) == </span><var>outer_code</var></samp>' and such that
either (a) `<samp><span class="samp">XEXP (</span><var>y</var><span class="samp">, </span><var>opno</var><span class="samp">) == </span><var>x</var></samp>' or
(b) `<samp><span class="samp">XVEC (</span><var>y</var><span class="samp">, </span><var>opno</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>' contains <var>x</var>.

      <p><var>mode</var> is <var>x</var>'s machine mode, or for cases like <code>const_int</code> that
do not have a mode, the mode in which <var>x</var> is used.

      <p>In implementing this hook, you can use the construct
<code>COSTS_N_INSNS (</code><var>n</var><code>)</code> to specify a cost equal to <var>n</var> fast
instructions.

      <p>On entry to the hook, <code>*</code><var>total</var> contains a default estimate
for the cost of the expression.  The hook should modify this value as
necessary.  Traditionally, the default costs are <code>COSTS_N_INSNS (5)</code>
for multiplications, <code>COSTS_N_INSNS (7)</code> for division and modulus
operations, and <code>COSTS_N_INSNS (1)</code> for all other operations.

      <p>When optimizing for code size, i.e. when <code>speed</code> is
false, this target hook should be used to estimate the relative
size cost of an expression, again relative to <code>COSTS_N_INSNS</code>.

processed, and false when <code>rtx_cost</code> should recurse.

&mdash; Target Hook: int <b>TARGET_ADDRESS_COST</b> (<var>rtx address, machine_mode mode, addr_space_t as, bool speed</var>)<var><a name="index-TARGET_005fADDRESS_005fCOST-4517"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This hook computes the cost of an addressing mode that contains
<var>address</var>.  If not defined, the cost is computed from
the <var>address</var> expression and the <code>TARGET_RTX_COST</code> hook.

      <p>For most CISC machines, the default cost is a good approximation of the
true cost of the addressing mode.  However, on RISC machines, all
instructions normally have the same length and execution time.  Hence
all addresses will have equal costs.

      <p>In cases where more than one form of an address is known, the form with
the lowest cost will be used.  If multiple forms have the same, lowest,
cost, the one that is the most complex will be used.

      <p>For example, suppose an address that is equal to the sum of a register
and a constant is used twice in the same basic block.  When this macro
is not defined, the address will be computed in a register and memory
references will be indirect through that register.  On machines where
the cost of the addressing mode containing the sum is no higher than
that of a simple indirect reference, this will produce an additional
instruction and possibly require an additional register.  Proper
specification of this macro eliminates this overhead for such machines.

      <p>This hook is never called with an invalid address.

      <p>On machines where an address involving more than one register is as
cheap as an address computation involving only one register, defining
<code>TARGET_ADDRESS_COST</code> to reflect this can cause two registers to
be live over a region of code where only one would have been if
<code>TARGET_ADDRESS_COST</code> were not defined in that manner.  This effect
should be considered in the definition of this macro.  Equivalent costs
should probably only be given to addresses with different numbers of
registers on machines with lots of registers.

&mdash; Target Hook: unsigned int <b>TARGET_MAX_NOCE_IFCVT_SEQ_COST</b> (<var>edge e</var>)<var><a name="index-TARGET_005fMAX_005fNOCE_005fIFCVT_005fSEQ_005fCOST-4518"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This hook returns a value in the same units as <code>TARGET_RTX_COSTS</code>,
giving the maximum acceptable cost for a sequence generated by the RTL
if-conversion pass when conditional execution is not available. 
The RTL if-conversion pass attempts to convert conditional operations
that would require a branch to a series of unconditional operations and
<code>mov</code><var>mode</var><code>cc</code> insns.  This hook returns the maximum cost of the
unconditional instructions and the <code>mov</code><var>mode</var><code>cc</code> insns. 
RTL if-conversion is cancelled if the cost of the converted sequence
is greater than the value returned by this hook.

      <p><code>e</code> is the edge between the basic block containing the conditional
branch to the basic block which would be executed if the condition
were true.

      <p>The default implementation of this hook uses the
<code>max-rtl-if-conversion-[un]predictable</code> parameters if they are set,
and uses a multiple of <code>BRANCH_COST</code> otherwise.

<blockquote><p>This predicate controls the use of the eager delay slot filler to disallow
speculatively executed instructions being placed in delay slots.  Targets
such as certain MIPS architectures possess both branches with and without
delay slots.  As the eager delay slot filler can decrease performance,
disabling it is beneficial when ordinary branches are available.  Use of
delay slot branches filled using the basic filler is often still desirable
as the delay slot can hide a pipeline bubble.
