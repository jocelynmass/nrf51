<h3 class="section">4.10 Debugging Programs with Multiple Threads</h3>

<p><a name="index-threads-of-execution-170"></a><a name="index-multiple-threads-171"></a><a name="index-switching-threads-172"></a>In some operating systems, such as GNU/Linux and Solaris, a single program
may have more than one <dfn>thread</dfn> of execution.  The precise semantics
of threads differ from one operating system to another, but in general
the threads of a single program are akin to multiple processes&mdash;except
that they share one address space (that is, they can all examine and
modify the same variables).  On the other hand, each thread has its own
registers and execution stack, and perhaps private memory.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> provides these facilities for debugging multi-thread
programs:

     <ul>
<li>automatic notification of new threads
<li>`<samp><span class="samp">thread </span><var>thread-id</var></samp>', a command to switch among threads
<li>`<samp><span class="samp">info threads</span></samp>', a command to inquire about existing threads
<li>`<samp><span class="samp">thread apply [</span><var>thread-id-list</var><span class="samp">] [</span><var>all</var><span class="samp">] </span><var>args</var></samp>',
a command to apply a command to a list of threads
<li>thread-specific breakpoints
<li>`<samp><span class="samp">set print thread-events</span></samp>', which controls printing of
messages on thread start and exit. 
<li>`<samp><span class="samp">set libthread-db-search-path </span><var>path</var></samp>', which lets
the user specify which <code>libthread_db</code> to use if the default choice
isn't compatible with the program. 
</ul>

   <p><a name="index-focus-of-debugging-173"></a><a name="index-current-thread-174"></a>The <span class="sc">gdb</span> thread debugging facility allows you to observe all
threads while your program runs&mdash;but whenever <span class="sc">gdb</span> takes
control, one thread in particular is always the focus of debugging. 
This thread is called the <dfn>current thread</dfn>.  Debugging commands show
program information from the perspective of the current thread.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bNew_007d-_0040var_007bsystag_007d-message-175"></a><a name="index-thread-identifier-_0028system_0029-176"></a><!-- FIXME-implementors!! It would be more helpful if the [New...] message -->
<!-- included GDB's numeric thread handle, so you could just go to that -->
<!-- thread without first checking `info threads'. -->
Whenever <span class="sc">gdb</span> detects a new thread in your program, it displays
the target system's identification for the thread with a message in the
form `<samp><span class="samp">[New </span><var>systag</var><span class="samp">]</span></samp>', where <var>systag</var> is a thread identifier
whose form varies depending on the particular system.  For example, on
<span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux, you might see

<pre class="smallexample">     [New Thread 0x41e02940 (LWP 25582)]
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">when <span class="sc">gdb</span> notices a new thread.  In contrast, on other systems,
the <var>systag</var> is simply something like `<samp><span class="samp">process 368</span></samp>', with no
further qualifier.

<!-- FIXME!! (1) Does the [New...] message appear even for the very first -->
<!-- thread of a program, or does it only appear for the -->
<!-- second-i.e.@: when it becomes obvious we have a multithread -->
<!-- program? -->
<!-- (2) *Is* there necessarily a first thread always?  Or do some -->
<!-- multithread systems permit starting a program with multiple -->
<!-- threads ab initio? -->
<p><a name="thread-numbers"></a>
<a name="index-thread-number_002c-per-inferior-177"></a><a name="index-thread-identifier-_0028GDB_0029-178"></a>For debugging purposes, <span class="sc">gdb</span> associates its own thread number
&mdash;always a single integer&mdash;with each thread of an inferior.  This
number is unique between all threads of an inferior, but not unique
between threads of different inferiors.

   <p><a name="index-qualified-thread-ID-179"></a>You can refer to a given thread in an inferior using the qualified
<var>inferior-num</var>.<var>thread-num</var> syntax, also known as
<dfn>qualified thread ID</dfn>, with <var>inferior-num</var> being the inferior
number and <var>thread-num</var> being the thread number of the given
inferior.  For example, thread <code>2.3</code> refers to thread number 3 of
inferior 2.  If you omit <var>inferior-num</var> (e.g., <code>thread 3</code>),
then <span class="sc">gdb</span> infers you're referring to a thread of the current
inferior.

   <p>Until you create a second inferior, <span class="sc">gdb</span> does not show the
<var>inferior-num</var> part of thread IDs, even though you can always use
the full <var>inferior-num</var>.<var>thread-num</var> form to refer to threads
of inferior 1, the initial inferior.

   <p><a name="thread-ID-lists"></a>
<a name="index-thread-ID-lists-180"></a>Some commands accept a space-separated <dfn>thread ID list</dfn> as
argument.  A list element can be:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>A thread ID as shown in the first field of the `<samp><span class="samp">info threads</span></samp>'
display, with or without an inferior qualifier.  E.g., `<samp><span class="samp">2.1</span></samp>' or
`<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>'.

     <li>A range of thread numbers, again with or without an inferior
qualifier, as in <var>inf</var>.<var>thr1</var>-<var>thr2</var> or
<var>thr1</var>-<var>thr2</var>.  E.g., `<samp><span class="samp">1.2-4</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">2-4</span></samp>'.

     <li>All threads of an inferior, specified with a star wildcard, with or
without an inferior qualifier, as in <var>inf</var>.<code>*</code> (e.g.,
`<samp><span class="samp">1.*</span></samp>') or <code>*</code>.  The former refers to all threads of the
given inferior, and the latter form without an inferior qualifier
refers to all threads of the current inferior.

        </ol>

   <p>For example, if the current inferior is 1, and inferior 7 has one
thread with ID 7.1, the thread list `<samp><span class="samp">1 2-3 4.5 6.7-9 7.*</span></samp>'
includes threads 1 to 3 of inferior 1, thread 5 of inferior 4, threads
7 to 9 of inferior 6 and all threads of inferior 7.  That is, in
expanded qualified form, the same as `<samp><span class="samp">1.1 1.2 1.3 4.5 6.7 6.8 6.9
7.1</span></samp>'.

   <p><a name="global-thread-numbers"></a>
<a name="index-global-thread-number-181"></a><a name="index-global-thread-identifier-_0028GDB_0029-182"></a>In addition to a <em>per-inferior</em> number, each thread is also
assigned a unique <em>global</em> number, also known as <dfn>global
thread ID</dfn>, a single integer.  Unlike the thread number component of
the thread ID, no two threads have the same global ID, even when
you're debugging multiple inferiors.

   <p>From <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s perspective, a process always has at least one
thread.  In other words, <span class="sc">gdb</span> assigns a thread number to the
program's &ldquo;main thread&rdquo; even if the program is not multi-threaded.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0024_005fthread_0040r_007b_002c-convenience-variable_007d-183"></a><a name="index-g_t_0024_005fgthread_0040r_007b_002c-convenience-variable_007d-184"></a>The debugger convenience variables `<samp><span class="samp">$_thread</span></samp>' and
`<samp><span class="samp">$_gthread</span></samp>' contain, respectively, the per-inferior thread number
and the global thread number of the current thread.  You may find this
useful in writing breakpoint conditional expressions, command scripts,
and so forth.  See <a href="Convenience-Vars.html#Convenience-Vars">Convenience Variables</a>, for
general information on convenience variables.

   <p>If <span class="sc">gdb</span> detects the program is multi-threaded, it augments the
usual message about stopping at a breakpoint with the ID and name of
the thread that hit the breakpoint.

<pre class="smallexample">     Thread 2 "client" hit Breakpoint 1, send_message () at client.c:68
</pre>
   <p>Likewise when the program receives a signal:

<pre class="smallexample">     Thread 1 "main" received signal SIGINT, Interrupt.
</pre>
     
<a name="index-info-threads-185"></a>
<dl><dt><code>info threads </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>thread-id-list</var><span class="roman">]</span><dd>
Display information about one or more threads.  With no arguments
displays information about all threads.  You can specify the list of
threads that you want to display using the thread ID list syntax
(see <a href="thread-ID-lists.html#thread-ID-lists">thread ID lists</a>).

     <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> displays for each thread (in this order):

          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>the per-inferior thread number assigned by <span class="sc">gdb</span>

          <li>the global thread number assigned by <span class="sc">gdb</span>, if the `<samp><span class="samp">-gid</span></samp>'
option was specified

          <li>the target system's thread identifier (<var>systag</var>)

          <li>the thread's name, if one is known.  A thread can either be named by
the user (see <code>thread name</code>, below), or, in some cases, by the
program itself.

          <li>the current stack frame summary for that thread
          </ol>

     <p class="noindent">An asterisk `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' to the left of the <span class="sc">gdb</span> thread number
indicates the current thread.

     <p>For example,
</dl>
   <!-- end table here to get a little more width for example -->

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) info threads
       Id   Target Id         Frame
     * 1    process 35 thread 13  main (argc=1, argv=0x7ffffff8)
       2    process 35 thread 23  0x34e5 in sigpause ()
       3    process 35 thread 27  0x34e5 in sigpause ()
         at threadtest.c:68
</pre>
   <p>If you're debugging multiple inferiors, <span class="sc">gdb</span> displays thread
IDs using the qualified <var>inferior-num</var>.<var>thread-num</var> format. 
Otherwise, only <var>thread-num</var> is shown.

   <p>If you specify the `<samp><span class="samp">-gid</span></samp>' option, <span class="sc">gdb</span> displays a column
indicating each thread's global thread ID:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) info threads
       Id   GId  Target Id             Frame
       1.1  1    process 35 thread 13  main (argc=1, argv=0x7ffffff8)
       1.2  3    process 35 thread 23  0x34e5 in sigpause ()
       1.3  4    process 35 thread 27  0x34e5 in sigpause ()
     * 2.1  2    process 65 thread 1   main (argc=1, argv=0x7ffffff8)
</pre>
   <p>On Solaris, you can display more information about user threads with a
Solaris-specific command:

     <dl>
<dt><code>maint info sol-threads</code><dd><a name="index-maint-info-sol_002dthreads-186"></a><a name="index-thread-info-_0028Solaris_0029-187"></a>Display info on Solaris user threads. 
</dl>

     
<a name="index-thread-_0040var_007bthread_002did_007d-188"></a>
<dl><dt><code>thread </code><var>thread-id</var><dd>Make thread ID <var>thread-id</var> the current thread.  The command
argument <var>thread-id</var> is the <span class="sc">gdb</span> thread ID, as shown in
the first field of the `<samp><span class="samp">info threads</span></samp>' display, with or without an
inferior qualifier (e.g., `<samp><span class="samp">2.1</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>').

     <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> responds by displaying the system identifier of the
thread you selected, and its current stack frame summary:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) thread 2
          [Switching to thread 2 (Thread 0xb7fdab70 (LWP 12747))]
          #0  some_function (ignore=0x0) at example.c:8
          8	    printf ("hello\n");
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">As with the `<samp><span class="samp">[New ...]</span></samp>' message, the form of the text after
`<samp><span class="samp">Switching to</span></samp>' depends on your system's conventions for identifying
threads.

     <p><a name="index-thread-apply-189"></a><a name="index-apply-command-to-several-threads-190"></a><br><dt><code>thread apply [</code><var>thread-id-list</var><code> | all [-ascending]] </code><var>command</var><dd>The <code>thread apply</code> command allows you to apply the named
<var>command</var> to one or more threads.  Specify the threads that you
want affected using the thread ID list syntax (see <a href="thread-ID-lists.html#thread-ID-lists">thread ID lists</a>), or specify <code>all</code> to apply to all threads.  To apply a
command to all threads in descending order, type <kbd>thread apply all
</kbd><var>command</var>.  To apply a command to all threads in ascending order,
type <kbd>thread apply all -ascending </kbd><var>command</var>.

     <p><a name="index-thread-name-191"></a><a name="index-name-a-thread-192"></a><br><dt><code>thread name [</code><var>name</var><code>]</code><dd>This command assigns a name to the current thread.  If no argument is

appears in the `<samp><span class="samp">info threads</span></samp>' display.

     <p>On some systems, such as <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux, <span class="sc">gdb</span> is able to
determine the name of the thread as given by the OS.  On these
systems, a name specified with `<samp><span class="samp">thread name</span></samp>' will override the
system-give name, and removing the user-specified name will cause
<span class="sc">gdb</span> to once again display the system-specified name.

     <p>As well as being the complement to the `<samp><span class="samp">thread name</span></samp>' command,
this command also allows you to identify a thread by its target
<var>systag</var>.  For instance, on <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux, the target <var>systag</var>
is the LWP id.

its default value (<code>$sdir:$pdir</code> on <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux and Solaris systems). 
Internally, the default value comes from the <code>LIBTHREAD_DB_SEARCH_PATH</code>
macro.

     <p>On <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux and Solaris systems, <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses a &ldquo;helper&rdquo;
<code>libthread_db</code> library to obtain information about threads in the
inferior process.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> will use `<samp><span class="samp">libthread-db-search-path</span></samp>'
to find <code>libthread_db</code>.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> also consults first if inferior
specific thread debugging library loading is enabled
by `<samp><span class="samp">set auto-load libthread-db</span></samp>' (see <a href="libthread_005fdb_002eso_002e1-file.html#libthread_005fdb_002eso_002e1-file">libthread_db.so.1 file</a>).

     <p>A special entry `<samp><span class="samp">$sdir</span></samp>' for `<samp><span class="samp">libthread-db-search-path</span></samp>'
refers to the default system directories that are
normally searched for loading shared libraries.  The `<samp><span class="samp">$sdir</span></samp>' entry
is the only kind not needing to be enabled by `<samp><span class="samp">set auto-load libthread-db</span></samp>'
(see <a href="libthread_005fdb_002eso_002e1-file.html#libthread_005fdb_002eso_002e1-file">libthread_db.so.1 file</a>).

     <p>A special entry `<samp><span class="samp">$pdir</span></samp>' for `<samp><span class="samp">libthread-db-search-path</span></samp>'
refers to the directory from which <code>libpthread</code>
was loaded in the inferior process.

     <p>For any <code>libthread_db</code> library <span class="sc">gdb</span> finds in above directories,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> attempts to initialize it with the current inferior process. 
If this initialization fails (which could happen because of a version
mismatch between <code>libthread_db</code> and <code>libpthread</code>), <span class="sc">gdb</span>
will unload <code>libthread_db</code>, and continue with the next directory. 
If none of <code>libthread_db</code> libraries initialize successfully,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will issue a warning and thread debugging will be disabled.

     <p>Setting <code>libthread-db-search-path</code> is currently implemented
